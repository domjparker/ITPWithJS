// the let variable was created within a block, and therefore is block scoped.
// When we attempt to console.log it, the it produces an error because the let variable created doesn't exist outside of the block

// The first 3 console.logs take place, however line 6 produces an error because you can't reassign a value to a const variable.

5.
// This logs 'qux' to the console because although foo is reassigned within a block, because it was first initiated outside of the block it can therefore be accessed outside of the block with the reassignment still valid.

6.
// It won't produce an error, but the const declared in the block will have no effect on changing or reassigning the const outside the block because it is a const variable, not a let variable.
